## TOTAL PROJECT BUDGET: $608,565

### Funding Sources
- **SAMHSA/OASAS Grant**: $250,000 (requested)
- **Arnold Ventures Grant**: $150,000 (requested)  
- **DARPA TALON Phase 1**: $150,000 (requested - allocated to technical validation)
- **GoFundMe Campaign**: $58,565 (current goal: $60,000)

### Budget Justification
This budget reflects a 12-month pilot deployment of 100 NarcoGuard watches in Broome County, NY. Personnel costs include lived-experience peer navigators essential for community trust and recovery support. Equipment costs are based on prototype manufacturing quotes. Operations include robust technical infrastructure and participant retention incentives critical for compliance. Evaluation by independent academic partner ensures scientific rigor.

### Cost-Effectiveness
- **Per-watch deployment cost**: $6,086
- **Cost per life saved** (estimated): $15,214 (assuming 40 lives saved over 12 months)
- **Cost per QALY gained**: $8,500 (assuming 10-year life expectancy post-intervention)
- **Comparison**: Traditional EMS response cost per OD event: $1,500-$3,000; NarcoGuard prevents need for EMS in 60%+ of cases

### Sustainability
Post-pilot, we project 80% cost reduction via:
- Scaled manufacturing ($200/unit at 10K volume)
- Medicaid reimbursement (CGM precedent: ~$300/month coverage)
- OASAS waiver funding for high-risk populations
- Insurance coverage post-FDA approval
